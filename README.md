This project is a car rental system developed using Java Swing, designed to provide a user-friendly interface for managing car bookings and fleet operations. It features two main user roles: customers, who can search, book, and view cars, and administrators, who can add, remove, and manage available vehicles. The interface uses a CardLayout for seamless navigation between panels, with data stored dynamically in an `ArrayList` for available cars and a `HashMap` for reservations. The project demonstrates core concepts of GUI development, event handling, and data management in Java. Future enhancements could include data persistence, user authentication, and improved validation for a more robust system.
